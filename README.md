# Affair_predict
 
This repository contains code for predicting whether or not someone will have an affair. The code uses a Machine Learning, Random Forest classifier to predict the target variable, `affairs`  , from a set of features. The features include the person's age, years married, religiousness, education, rating, gender, children, and occupation.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started, clone the repository: </p>

``` git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/affair-prediction.git ```

<p> to run the code </p>

``` python affair.py ```
<h3>Results</h3>
The code achieves an F1 score of 0.85 on the test set. This means that the classifier correctly predicts whether or not someone will have an affair 85% of the time.

<h3>Limitations</h3>
The code has a few limitations. First, it only uses a single classifier. It would be interesting to see how the results would change if other classifiers were used, such as a support vector machine or a neural network. Second, the code only uses a subset of the features available in the dataset. It would be interesting to see how the results would change if more features were used.

<h3>Future Work</h3>
There are a few things that could be done to improve the code in the future. First, more classifiers could be used to see how the results compare. Second, more features could be used to see how the results change. Finally, the code could be made more generalizable so that it can be used to predict affairs in other populations.
